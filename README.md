# TarotSample
Tarot for Writers applet.
The purpose of this applet will be to allow a writer who is in the process of writing to ask The Tarot about some aspect of the writer's story. With the card drawn, the user sees the card meanings and can write their ideas on what the drawing means to the scene, or piece, they are working on.
